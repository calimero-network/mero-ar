//! Mero AR — collaborative spatial editing on Calimero.
//!
//! One context = one room. State holds the scene graph (objects with 3D
//! transforms), members, per-user camera presence, spatial comments, advisory
//! object locks, a monotonic version counter, and a blob ref to the shared
//! `ARWorldMap` used for cross-device relocalization.
//!
//! This is the 3D analogue of the MeroDesign 2D canvas contract: SceneObject ≈
//! Element, Presence ≈ cursor, SpatialComment ≈ comment. Conflict resolution is
//! version-then-timestamp LWW via `MergeableTrait`.
//!
//! # Identity (core 0.11.0-rc.24)
//!
//! Nothing here trusts a client-supplied member id. A member IS an account —
//! `env::account_id()`, the person — and so is every ownership record: the
//! roster, an object's author, a lock holder, a comment's author, the
//! `AccessControl` admin tier and the `Ownable` room name. Someone in the room
//! on a phone and an iPad is one member holding one role, not two.
//!
//! rc.20 keyed the roster by device and carried a self-registration map to reach
//! the account a grant had to name. rc.23 retires that twice over: the legacy
//! `executor_id()` shim now resolves to the account (core #3510), and group
//! membership is stated in accounts (core #3522). So the bridge is gone and a
//! member id is a 64-hex `AccountId` everywhere — including in what an admin
//! types to grant a role.
//!
//! `env::device_id()` survives in exactly one place: presence. See
//! [`MeroAR::update_presence`].

// ── Convergence ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Every record below is stored as a COLLECTION VALUE (`UnorderedMap<_, T>`),
// and core 0.11.0-rc.32 changed what that means for a hand-written `Mergeable`.
//
// Before #3807 a collection entry was merged by matching on its `crdt_type`,
// and a type that declared nothing resolved last-write-wins with the app's
// `merge` NEVER CALLED. Every `impl Mergeable` here was therefore dead code —
// it compiled, it was unit-testable, and the node ignored it. rc.32 refuses to
// compile that ambiguity: a type implementing `Mergeable` must now say how it
// merges, either `#[derive(Mergeable)]` (converge structurally, merge not
// dispatched) or `#[app::mergeable]` (dispatch to the rule below).
//
// These four take `#[app::mergeable]`, because the rule is genuinely ours —
// version-then-timestamp LWW, not field-by-field delegation, and the fields are
// bare `String`/`u64`, which the derive could not converge anyway. The
// attribute also generates the `RekeyTarget` impl each type used to write by
// hand (flat records, so re-keying stays a no-op).
//
// ⚠️ Their `merge` is reachable for the first time, so it has to actually hold
// up. core's contract is that merge be "deterministic, commutative,
// associative, idempotent and total", and a bare `if other.ts > self.ts`
// satisfies none of the last three at an exact tie: two different edits
// carrying the same timestamp each keep their own copy, and the replicas stay
// divergent with nothing reporting it. `take_if_greater` closes that by making
// the merge a maximum over a TOTAL order — clock first, canonical bytes second.

/// Deterministic tie-break for two records whose LWW clocks compare equal.
///
/// borsh is canonical for these flat records, so comparing the encodings is a
/// total order on values, and equal values compare equal — which is what makes
/// the merge idempotent as well as commutative.
